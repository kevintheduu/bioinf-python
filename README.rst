Bioinformatics with Python Cookbook
===================================

## HI!

# Kevin Velasco here with another project. In this repo, I will be exploring and hoping to combine my data sciene skills along with my molecular biology knowledge. Genomic studies encompass loads of data, and today there are bioinformatics open-source software to help process this data. I have cloned this repo, which is a github repo from the book `Bioinformatics with Python Cookbook`_


This is the github repository with code samples for
`Bioinformatics with Python Cookbook`_


The suggested starting point is the Welcome_ notebook.
